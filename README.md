# Nextflow homepage
Wow, finally! A homepage for Nextflow!

The Nextflow homepage, as seen [here](https://nextflow.cloud), made in SolidJS. Not too much else to say about this one. 

To start a development server, run `bun dev`. To build the project, run `bun run build`. You can use any static file server to serve the files in the `dist` directory.
